# nvim-config
My personal modern NeoVim config

This repo is intended for others to use as a reference,
some parts of the config is pretty hacky and needs a bit of polishing, namely:

- For some of the plugins I simply copy and pasted the default config :D.
This is a bad practice, I used to have a large vim config full of those things and the result is a shit ton of unexpected behavier,
so it's better to get things sorted from the start
- I'm still using some oldschool plugins while there are better modern alternatives
(This was my first attempt at a modern NeoVim setup, so for some plugins I just used the ones that I used before)

TODOs:
- Fancy startup screen
- Better git integration
- Clean up Lua config code
- Optimize startup time
